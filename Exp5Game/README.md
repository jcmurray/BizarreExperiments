1. Ensure the BlackBerry 10 device is connected to a WiFi network and has a valid IP. You can obtain this by going to Settings->About->Network
2. Run the app. This will start a server which listens on 2 ports, one for each team: 8081 and 8082.
3. Players can then open their browser and connect to the BlackBerry 10 device IP and their team's port number. E.g http://192.168.0.250:8081 (for Team 1).
